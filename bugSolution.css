The solution avoids the use of `!important` and uses a more precise selector to target the specific element:

```css
.container {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container p {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.container p.special {
  font-size: 14px;
}

/* No need for .container .special rule */
```

By removing the `.container .special` selector and ensuring that the `p.special` selector is sufficient to target the elements with the desired `font-size`, we avoid the specificity and `!important` conflict. This also improves the maintainability and readability of the CSS code.
